CE01ISSM,,2014-04-17T20:53:00Z,2017-04-05T00:00:00Z,"For telemetered and recovered_host data, a race condition exists in the CPM firmware when transferring daily log files harvested from the various sub-components in a buoy system over the Iridium RUDICS connection. Data accumulates in the daily log files for an instrument, but only one record is transmitted to shore. Therefore, telemetered and recovered_host data are sparse (if available at all), but the recovered_instrument datasets should contain all available data.",,8151,Need to update end date when this is fixed - probably spring 2017,lori,2017-04-05T00:00:00Z
