GI01SUMO,1,2015-02-15T00:00:00,2015-08-22T11:00:00,"Status data sent from the buoy included leak detects in the buoy well, drop in battery voltage, and loss of wind turbine input. Upon recovery, the buoy was primarily intact but several instruments were damaged and/or missing. Ice build-up on the tower is speculated to be the cause for much of the damage.",,,,lori,2017-04-05T00:00:00
GI01SUMO,2,2016-01-27T00:00:00,2016-07-19T00:00:00,"A period of violent weather caused power outages on multiple instruments. Functional instruments could continue to collect data using internal battery power and storage cards. Upon recovery, the buoy well was flooded.",,9583,,lori,2017-04-05T00:00:00
GI01SUMO,3,2016-12-27T00:00:00,2017-04-07T00:00:00,"There is evidence of ice build-up on the surface buoy tower. Wind turbines are disabled and the battery charge state has been declining steadily. As of 1/15/2017, all DCLs have been shut down and the telemetry schedule has been reduced to conserve power. Battery-powered instruments will continue to collect data. UPDATE 4/7/2017: With increasing daylight at this location, there is now sufficient power available from PV panels to re-establish limited high-bandwidth telemetry and data transmission. Instruments on DCL11 are sending data to shore. The backlog of data stored on instruments with batteries will slowly backfill over time.",,11758,Update end time as the deployment progresses,lori,2017-04-07T00:00:00
