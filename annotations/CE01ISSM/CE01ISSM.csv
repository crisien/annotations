Data accumulates in the daily log files for an instrument, but only one record is transmitted to shore. Therefore, telemetered and recovered_host data are sparse (if available at all), but the recovered_instrument datasets should contain all available data.",,8151,Need to add end date when this is fixed - probably spring 2017,lori,2017-04-05T00:00:00
