streamed-ctdpf_sbe43_sample,D00003,2017-01-26T00:00:00Z,,"On Thursday, January 26th, the Shallow Profiler at Axial Base (SC03A) stopped during the profiler down cast. Analysis of the data indicates the Science Pod (SciP) turned around (commenced down cast profiles) below its normal ceiling due to wave action. The SciP completed three 10m steps down, as scheduled, and was approximately halfway into the fourth step when a speed mismatch of the level wind / winch occurred. Investigation of the engineering data revealed the EM cable is tangled on the drum. The current depth of the SciP is approximately 50m below the surface. Additional analysis and controlled recovery efforts will continue this week. The Science Pod is powered and science/engineering data continues to be collected.",NOT_EVALUATED,11872,,friedrich,2017-07-11T00:00:00Z
