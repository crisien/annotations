practical_salinity,D00004,2016-10-08T08:00:01Z,2016-12-05T20:00:01Z,Instrument should have been deployed around 60m but pressure values recorded around 100 dbar. This could be a bad pressure sensor - will know more when the instrument is recovered in the summer of 2017.,SUSPECT,,MIO investigating. Could be a bad pressure sensor.,lori,2017-05-12T00:00:00Z
